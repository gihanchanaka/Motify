# Motify - Notification System for Moodle

## History

### Version 0
Motify project was proposed by [Kesara](https://lk.linkedin.com/in/66kesara99) for [ACES Hackathon 2016](http://aces.ce.pdn.ac.lk/hackathon2016/). This desktop app was written in JAVA to enable its use on both Linux and Windows systems. This was before moodle released its Desktop app.
The app exploited a bug in moodle sites where the authentication token doesnt expire to connect the application to online content! This was a quick hack for the hackathon timeline.
Kesara managed the team which consisted of [Gihan](http://gihan.me) who handled the backend code, [Chandima](http://teambitecode.com/people/chandima) who handled the frontend code and [Hasindu](https://lk.linkedin.com/in/hasindu-ramanayaka-08a882bb), [Udaree](https://lk.linkedin.com/in/udaree-kanewala-aa0b92123), [Kalana](https://plus.google.com/110004068371184705486), [Rangana](https://lk.linkedin.com/in/rangana-de-silva-038012a3), Indika who wrote code for both backend and front end, prepared documentation etc:.
Suprisingly, the team won the "Best Software Project" award at the hackathon and Kesara won the award for "The Most Popular Idea".
